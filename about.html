<h2>Weiyi Pan</h2>


<p>
    Dr. Weiyi Pan will join the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the National University of Singapore in August, 2025. Growing up near the third largest lake in China, Weiyi has always had a deep appreciation for waterâ€”not only as an essential resource for communities and industries, but also as a core element of all natural ecosystems. As a result, the decisions we make on how to manage water and wastewater can have profound effects on all living things and their future generations. Realizing that "water problems" are never just siloed to the water sector, Weiyi will launch the Pan Lab with the understanding that water challenges often lie at the nexus of agriculture, energy, society, and the environment. With hopes of taking a more holistic approach, the Pan Lab aims to develop effective socio-technical interventions that revitalize our infrastructure to better serve the public. More specifically, the goal of the Pan Lab is to close the loop of wastewater management by facilitating water reuse, enabling resource recovery, and mitigating pollution.
